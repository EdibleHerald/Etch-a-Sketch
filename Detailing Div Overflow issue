Problem: smaller divs that are supposed to fill the canvas are larger than what can fit in the container div.
This causes overflow and the divs leak out of the container.

lets try 31x31 and run the calculations by hand:

What happens?

Well:

containerDiv height/width is 800 px
the area is 640,000 

it goes through determineHeightWidth(sqTotal)

sqTotal is 31x31 or 961 (Amount of squares in the canvas)

widthAndHeight is equal to Math.sqrt(containerDivArea/sqTotal)

in this case it is Math.sqrt(640,000/961)

the result is 25.806451612

IMPORTANT NOTE: When checking the dimensions of each div, they turn out to be 27.8 and not as the expected 25.8

Conclusion:
I didn't take notice of the border that I added to each div. I didnt notice until I used google's tools that very clearly showed me the errors of my way
